    Parameters
    ----------
    molecule: vermouth.molecule.Molecule
        A molecule with missing atoms
    anchor: integer
        Index to anchor node: a node with positions connected to a node without
    base: list of integers
        Indices to particles with positions connected to anchor

def _chiral(molecule, anchor, base, distance=(0.125, 0.125)):

    Generate coordinates for atoms bonded to chiral center
    based on two known substituents.

    This approach uses the positions of two substituents to
    generate coordinates for one or two atoms connected to
    a chiral center. The two atoms are indicated as `up` and
    `down`, referring to the direction with respect to the
    cross-product of the two substituents. If these control
    atoms are not given explicitly in order, then the control
    atoms are inferred from the connections of the anchor with
    known coordinates. In that case, the specific chirality
    of the center (R or S) cannot be controlled.

    NOTE: This function should probably be able to determine
          the weights of the substituents to allow placement
          based on R or S chirality.

    Parameters
    ----------
    molecule: vermouth.molecule.Molecule
